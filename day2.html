<h1> <u> cascadung style sheets</u></h1>
 <p>SS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

<p>Since different CSS modules are at different levels of stability, the CSS Working Group has chosen to publish this profile to define the current scope and state of Cascading Style Sheets as of 2020. This profile includes only specifications that we consider stable and for which we have enough implementation experience <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625242420602-a22dd7692b82?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHx0b3BpYy1mZWVkfDY4fDZzTVZqVExTa2VRfHxlbnwwfHx8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=60"></p>
